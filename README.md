# README

Very basic rails app that duplicates this issue.

https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/4068

To install:

`git clone git@github.com:lukebyrne/rails-vuetify-test.git`

`bundle install`

`yarn install`

To run open two terminal tabs:

Run `rails s` in one.

Run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` in another.

The VueJS/Vuetify app lives in `/app/javascript/vuetify-datatable` and is just a vanilla VueJS app using Vuetify.
